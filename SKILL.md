# genviral Partner API Skill

> **TL;DR:** Wraps genviral's Partner API into 42+ bash commands. Core flow: `get-pack` → analyze images (metadata + vision) → `generate` with `pinned_images` → `render` → visual review (hard gate) → `create-post` → log to `workspace/performance/log.json`. Auth via `GENVIRAL_API_KEY`. Config in `defaults.yaml`. Instance data in `workspace/`.

## What This Skill Does

- **Multi-Platform Posting:** Video or slideshow posts across TikTok, Instagram, or any connected account
- **File Management:** Upload videos/images to genviral's CDN
- **AI Slideshow Generation:** Photo carousels from prompts, rendered to images
- **Template System:** Reusable slideshow structures, convert winners to templates
- **Pack Management:** Image packs as slideshow backgrounds
- **Analytics:** KPIs, post-level metrics, tracked accounts, refresh triggers
- **Niche Intelligence:** One-call trend research (`trend-brief`) for hashtags, sounds, creators, posting windows, and hook angles
- **Content Pipeline:** Full automation from prompt to posted content
- **Performance Tracking:** Post log, hook tracking, weekly review
- **Hook Library:** Maintain and evolve a library of proven content hooks

## How It Works

1. Generate or upload media
2. Create a post targeting one or more accounts
3. Schedule or publish (for TikTok slideshows, optionally save as drafts so you can add trending audio before publishing — music selection requires human judgment for best results)
4. Track performance via analytics
5. Learn and optimize

All configuration in `defaults.yaml`. Secrets via environment variables. Everything posted shows up in the Genviral dashboard.

## First-Time Setup

If fresh install, read `docs/setup.md` and walk the user through onboarding conversationally:
1. Set API key and verify it works
2. List accounts and pick which to post to
3. Discuss image strategy (existing packs, create new, generate per post, or mix)
4. Optionally set up product context and brand voice together

No hardcoded defaults. Ask the user what they prefer and adapt. Everything done through this skill shows up in the Genviral dashboard, so the user always has full visibility and control.

## Command Routing

Load only what you need for the current task:

| Task | Read |
|------|------|
| Account discovery, file upload | `docs/api/accounts-files.md` |
| Create, update, list, delete posts | `docs/api/posts.md` |
| Slideshow generation, rendering, editing, text styles | `docs/api/slideshows.md` |
| Pack management, image selection (ANY pack workflow) | `docs/api/packs.md` |
| Template creation and management | `docs/api/templates.md` |
| Analytics queries and target management | `docs/api/analytics.md` |
| Research a specific niche quickly (trend + competitors + hooks) | `docs/api/analytics.md`, `docs/references/competitor-research.md`, `docs/prompts/hooks.md` |
| Full content pipeline, performance loop, CTA testing | `docs/api/pipeline.md` |
| Error codes, troubleshooting | `docs/api/errors.md` |

## Niche Research Mode (When user asks to research a niche)

When asked things like "research this niche", "find what works in this niche", or "give me niche intelligence":

1. Run `trend-brief` first for the niche keyword (`7d` baseline, then `24h` for freshness if needed).
2. Extract and report: top hashtags, top sounds, top creators, posting windows (UTC), recommended hook angles.
3. Run competitor deep-dive using `docs/references/competitor-research.md` (3-5 accounts minimum).
4. Produce a short actionable output with:
   - 3 hook angles to test
   - 2 CTA suggestions
   - 2 best posting windows
   - 5 hashtags to start with
   - 1 "gap to exploit" insight
5. Save findings to `workspace/performance/competitor-insights.md` and use them in subsequent content prompts.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

These apply regardless of what docs you've loaded:

1. **ALWAYS use `pinned_images`** when generating a slideshow with a pack. Never call `generate` with just `--pack-id` — the server will pick random images. Read `docs/api/packs.md` before any pack workflow.

2. **ALWAYS visually review every rendered slide** before posting. If any slide fails readability, fix it. This is a hard gate — not a suggestion.

3. **ALWAYS log to `workspace/performance/log.json`** immediately after posting. This is the canonical record.

4. **ALWAYS add a hook-tracker entry** after posting. No tracking = no learning.

5. **Never use em-dashes** in any generated content.

6. **Respect `workspace/`** — all instance data lives here. Do not write state files to the skill root.

## Script Usage

```bash
/path/to/genviral/scripts/genviral.sh <command> [options]
```

Requires `GENVIRAL_API_KEY` as an environment variable (format: `public_id.secret`). Loads defaults from `defaults.yaml`. Set `GENVIRAL_WORKSPACE_DIR` to override the workspace path (defaults to `workspace/` relative to the skill dir).

## Auto-Updates

This skill includes a self-updater that keeps skill-owned files in sync with the latest version from `fdarkaou/genviral-skill`.

```bash
bash scripts/update-skill.sh           # check + apply if updates available
bash scripts/update-skill.sh --dry-run # preview only, no changes
bash scripts/update-skill.sh --force   # force re-apply even if already current
```

**What gets updated (skill-owned):** `SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `docs/` (all subdirs)

**What never gets touched (user-owned):** `workspace/` — your data, context, hooks, and performance logs are always preserved.
