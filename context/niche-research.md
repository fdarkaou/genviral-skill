# Niche Research: Dev Tools / AI Boilerplates on TikTok

## What Works on Dev TikTok
- "I built X in Y hours" format crushes
- Screen recordings of shipping products
- Before/after comparisons (empty project vs working app)
- Pain point hooks ("spent 3 days on auth setup again")
- Carousel slideshows with tips/lists perform consistently
- Short, punchy content (15-30 sec or 5-6 slides)

## Top Performing Content Types
1. **Listicles**: "5 things every Next.js app needs" (high saves)
2. **Pain point hooks**: "Stop configuring auth from scratch" (high engagement)
3. **Social proof**: "This dev shipped in 2 days" (high shares)
4. **Tutorial snippets**: Quick code tips (high follows)
5. **Hot takes**: "You don't need to build auth yourself" (high comments)

## Competitor Accounts to Watch
- Ship-fast style boilerplate accounts
- AI tool showcase accounts
- Indie hacker accounts building in public

## Platform Notes (TikTok)
- Slideshow carousels: 9:16 ratio, 5-6 slides optimal
- First slide is everything (hook or scroll past)
- Captions should be conversational, not formal
- Best posting times: 9-11 AM and 7-9 PM (audience timezone)
- 3 posts/day is the sweet spot for growth
