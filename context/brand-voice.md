# Brand Voice: AnotherWrapper

## Tone
- Casual, developer-friendly, no corporate speak
- Confident but not arrogant
- Practical and results-oriented
- Slightly irreverent (we know boilerplate setup sucks)

## Language Rules
- Never use em-dashes
- No AI-sounding phrases (delve, harness, landscape, leverage)
- No tricolons ("Real X. Real Y. Real Z.")
- No negation structures ("Not X. Not Y. [real thing]")
- Vary sentence length aggressively
- Sound like texting a developer friend, not writing a blog post
- Use specific numbers and real examples
- Take stances, don't hedge

## Content Themes
1. **Ship faster**: Stop building infrastructure, start building products
2. **AI coding era**: The boilerplate is built for vibe coding with AI assistants
3. **Real results**: Show actual products people built with AnotherWrapper
4. **Developer pain points**: Auth setup hell, payment integration nightmares, "just one more config file"
5. **Indie hacker culture**: Building in public, shipping fast, MVPs over perfection

## Hashtags
Primary: #nextjs #aitools #saas #indiehacker #webdev #coding
Secondary: #typescript #startup #buildinpublic #developer #vibecoding
Avoid: Overused generic tags like #technology #innovation

## CTA Style
- Direct: "Link in bio" or "Check anotherwrapper.com"
- Never salesy or pushy
- Let the content sell itself
